Last night's blood moon, thought I saw you
It was just a dream
Same old cross streets I walk in my sleep
Where everything still leads
To a parallel place where I can twist fate
And I still feel like your's
But once I fall back down to earth
I have to close the door


And leave it all behind
Stop lookin' for signs
Only fools would do the same thing twice
I found out sometimes, love ain't worth the price
Only fools would do the same thing twice
I know better this time


Learn the hard way how to be brave
And take my own advice
I tried everything and anything
To let you go and set me free
But there's no easy way to say goodbye


And leave it all behind
Stop lookin' for signs
Only fools would do the same thing twice
I found out sometimes, love ain't worth the price
Only fools would do the same thing twice
I know better this time


I know better, I know better
I know better this time
I know better, I know better
I know better


For the first time I feel alright
Guess I'm learning how


To leave it all behind
Stop lookin' for signs
Only fools would do the same thing twice
I found out sometimes, love ain't worth the price
Only fools would do the same thing twice
I know better this time


I know better, I know better
I know better this time
I know better, I know better
I know better
